## Name
portfolio

## Description
In this project, I developed an interactive portfolio webpage. The buttons change color and size and the font changes size. The buttons also deploy to a section on the page and to websites. The header and nav bar change color when they shrink and the portfolio buttons stack. I used this website to figure out a different solution to integrate buttons and effects: https://dev.to/mimafogeus2/your-buttons-get-wider-on-hover-because-you-change-their-font-weight-here-s-how-to-solve-this-4bhi for reference. Here's the link to live server: http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html and a link to git hub deployment https://astandish.github.io/portfolio/
